I am teaching myself Python and I need all the help and collaboration I can get!

Currently following 'How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Think Python 3'.

At the time I'm typing this, 10th of August 2017, 0115 GMT, I am halfway through Chapter 8: Strings.

I started on this book roughly 2 & 1/2 weeks ago.

I have no programming experience nor any official schooling on the subject.

I am 23 years old working on an associates degree.

I am teaching myself Python in the hopes to get a good job or earn money aside from a 9-5 job.
