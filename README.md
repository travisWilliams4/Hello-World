~~ Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here ~~
6/19/2018

Just kidding, stay hopeful. Progress from the post below:

- Officially changed my major to computer programming
- Completed an intro to programming, into to database design, and PHP/MySql 1 class.
- Applying for entry level IT/software development jobs in the Omaha Metro area.

Having to take summer off from class due to army training has put a dent in my schooling
so I have begun taking up new projects as much as possible. So far I haven't encountered
anything I'm not capable of learning with proper time and training.

I am teaching myself Python and I need all the help and collaboration I can get!

Currently following 'How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Think Python 3'.

At the time I'm typing this, 10th of August 2017, 0115 GMT, I am halfway through Chapter 8: Strings.

I started on this book roughly 2 & 1/2 weeks ago.

I have no programming experience nor any official schooling on the subject.

I am 23 years old working on an associates degree.

I am teaching myself Python in the hopes to get a good job or earn money aside from a 9-5 job.
